# FRETISH-requirements
#### Matt Luckcuck January 2024


A repository of requirements sets for a variety of Use Cases, written in FRETISH which is the structured requirements language for the [Formal Requirements Elicitation Tool](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/) (FRET). The requirements sets were inititally built for demonstrating refactoring functionality in Mu-FRET. 

The FRETISH requirements are contained in the `.json` files in each directory. They can be opened by [importing](https://github.com/NASA-SW-VnV/fret/blob/master/fret-electron/docs/_media/user-interface/exportImport/import.md) then into FRET.
